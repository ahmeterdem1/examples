Jax is even faster. But none is as readable as vectorgebra. The purpose of this library is to be both usable and readable. By this way, we let developers easily implement their own algorithms on top of already existing ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "The readability of Python will let this project to be understood by every developer, to be seen from almost all perspectives. And Python is getting faster each day. Combination of those 2 factors will make this library a playground for developers to test different methods, to understand others methods faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The readability of Python creates a big potential for this project to be a great tool of education. Nobody will have to suffer the complicated nature of C++ to understand sophisticated numerical methods algorithms. Also, nobody will have to look at pseudocode that cannot and is not intended to really work to try to understand these sophisticated algorithms. The code here is both understandable easily, and works. To see the _understandable code_ work on real, takes the education to a different reality.\n",
