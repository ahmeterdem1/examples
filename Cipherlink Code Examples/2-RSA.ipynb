    "Ciphering can start from here. There are 4 ways of ciphering. _cipherlink.encryptorRsa_ and _cipherlink.decryptorRsa_ are toys that cipher the characters one by one. Ciphered version of a character will be the same everywhere, therefore this is just a mapping of the characters into some numbers. It can be demapped by just using theirr frequencies. _cipherlink.encryptorRsa2_ and _cipherlink.decryptorRsa2_ are usable versions of those. They group the characters by 2, use their concatenated ascii values as elements. Because of this grouping, every 2 character combination has a different mapping than the other. Now it is much harder to demap the result. Grouping is not carried to higher numbers like 5 or 10 because these functions are unstable. Floating point errors occur around %5 of the time.\n",
